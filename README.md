LastBite AI is an AI-powered food rescue platform built in 24 hours at ScarletHacks. It detects soon-to-expire food items using barcode/OCR scanning, predicts shelf life with ML, and connects users with donation centers using smart geolocation-based routingâ€”all to reduce food waste and empower community giving.
